### My Projects
1. **My approach to Kaggle's Titanic dataset (I made it to top 8% on Leaderboard!)** [NoteBook](https://github.com/peter-seweiha/peter-seweiha.github.io/blob/master/projects/3_The%20Titanic%20Dataset/The%20Titanic%20dataset.ipynb) <br />- *I focused heavily on Feature Engineering making sure I can extract as much information from the given dataset in addition to what I can assume based on my knowledge of this tragedy. Also selecting the right tree-based Algorithm and fine-tune the model hyperparameters*

2. **Forcast the no of daily customers for a restaurant chain (Time Series Analysis)** [NoteBook](https://github.com/peter-seweiha/peter-seweiha.github.io/blob/master/projects/8_TimeSeries/TimeSeries%20Project.ipynb) <br />- 
*Here I compared the performance of an ARIMA based model, FaceBook prophet, and a traditional XGB regression. Imagine who won!*
