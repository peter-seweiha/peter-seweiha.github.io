### Projects
1. **My approach to Kaggle's Titanic dataset (I made it to top 8% on Leaderboard!)** [NoteBook](https://github.com/peter-seweiha/peter-seweiha.github.io/blob/master/projects/3_The%20Titanic%20Dataset/My_solution.ipynb) - *I focused heavily on Feature Engineering making sure I can extract as much information from the given dataset in addition to what I can assume based on my knowledge of this tragedy*

2. **Predict no of a restaurant chain's daily customers 4 weeks in the future(Time Series Analysis)** [NoteBook](https://github.com/peter-seweiha/peter-seweiha.github.io/blob/master/projects/8_TimeSeries/TimeSeries%20Project.ipynb) - 
*Here I compared the performance of an ARIMA based model, FaceBook prophet, and a traditional XGB regression. Imagine who won!*

### Quick Algorithm Implementation
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** - Classify restaurant reviews into positive/negative  [NoteBook](https://github.com/peter-seweiha/peter-seweiha.github.io/blob/master/projects/4_NLP/%20Natural%20Language%20Processing.ipynb)

- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** - Bank customers' churn prediction  [NoteBook](https://github.com/peter-seweiha/peter-seweiha.github.io/blob/master/projects/5_ANN/Churn%20Prediction%20using%20Deep%20Learning.ipynb)

- **Unsupervised Learning - (K-means clustering)** - Categorising Shpping mall customers based on their income and spending habits  [NoteBook](https://github.com/peter-seweiha/peter-seweiha.github.io/blob/master/projects/6_k-means/K-means%20clustering.ipynb)

- **Unsupervised Learning - Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)** - Predicting if a customer group will like a new wine based on product parameters  [NoteBook](https://github.com/peter-seweiha/peter-seweiha.github.io/blob/master/projects/7_PCA/Principal%20Component%20Analysis%20(PCA).ipynb)
